Enyo Launcher Changelog

2.0.7 ("Lock and load.  Rip and tear.")

Qt6 is now REQUIRED.  I consider Qt5 old and busted.  If you have a distro that does not support Qt6, well, sorry.  Most should, including Ubuntu (I don't use Ubuntu any more,
but I'm going to guess its required install for Qt6 source compilations is qt6-default -- if that's not correct, go ask Ubuntu).

2.0.6 ("Slowly and painfully you get up and return to the fray.")

Non-essential upgrade with nothing really fixed because this program is sheer
and utter perfection that no one will ever have to fix ever because there are
no bugs and no problems in this perfect bit of code.

Cough.  Yeah, right.

So basically, don't even bother updating.  Because nothing has really changed
except for some text here and there.  The title bar's "Enyo Launcher for Doom
[version number]" bugged the HELL out of me because it implied that it was a
launcher for a specific version of Doom, not that the version was Enyo
Launcher's.  So that got fixed.  A few other texts here and there were changed
a bit/clarified, mostly in tooltips.

So yeah, don't even bother upgrading unless that title text bugs you to death
like it did me.  It's not even worth it.  Dude that updates Arch's AUR (THANK
YOU BY THE WAY, YOU ARE MY HERO), don't bother with this.  This is an update
for me and me alone.

And the others who are bugged to death by that title text.  Yeah.

2.0.5 ("A true hero in the face of something so evil")

Microsoft is pure evil and this update marks the triumphant return to Gitlab.

But a couple things needed to be fixed:

FIX: When adding a new engine,fixed the path to the previously selected engine
remained until the new engine was re-selected.  It now correctly shows an
empty path.

FIX: Update cmake minimum version; previous minimum version was depreciated.

2.0.4 ("The Stagnant Demesne")

I have changed all other identifiers to the new name "Enyo Launcher".  The new binary name will be "enyo-launcher"; it may be necessary to uninstall completely the previous enyo-doom version to clear out all remnants of it.

Enyo Launcher should migrate enyo-doom settings to the new configuration file; if it does not, I apologize and you will either need to find and manually copy enyo-doom.conf to enyo-launcher.conf in its new directory or simply reconfigure everything.

2.0.3 ("NIGHTMARE!")

An incidental release that simply cleans up unused code and old features left behind in the current client.

Also, I have changed the primary name of "enyo-doom" to "Enyo Launcher". Its binary and this repository will still be "enyo-doom" but I prefer to call the actual program "Enyo Launcher".

There is zero reason to update to this latest version if you don't care about any of this (and you shouldn't) -- nothing in this release fixes any bugs or adds or removes any features compared to the last version. Just think of it as a vanity release.

2.0.2 ("THE END")

The end.  

Using free software baked in icons because using standard icons just doesn't
work.  Oh, sure, here, all you have to do to have icons is use this method of
using whatever icons your user is!  This cannot possibly fail miserably every
single time.  If this doesn't work then to hell with it.  I knew using icons was a bad idea.
But noooo, I had to save space, didn't I?  I needed five hundred buttons on
that one line, didn't I?  I wanted it to look nice, didn't I?  That's what I
get for caring about how something looks.  My lesson of the day: accept
yourself for who you are no matter how hideous because disguising yourself
behind beauty is nothing but a dark pit of failure and too much work down the
road.  You're beautiful just the way you are.

Also, what I get for trusting the Qt documentation.  "Sure, use this in your 
code, it'll work!  We're not going to strongly imply we JUST NOW added this
option in Qt so that any distro that isn't bleeding edge will fail to compile
your application.  Trust Qt!  We are awesome!"  I'm never going to write a GUI
application again.  What a pain.

I'm an old, bitter man.  What a joke that this is probably going to be my only
legacy, such that it is.  Time to drown my sorrows in the deepest pits of Hell
playing this game that I have loved since its release, and how modern games
can not even compare to its near-perfection, especially not NuDoom.  What a
joke of a game.  How dare they release a new Doom, and especially how dare
they name it simply "Doom" to mask the vastly superior original.  Go play old
games, preferably ones pre-1995, the only good era of gaming.

It's been something.

2.0.1 ("Hell is a deep, dark, foul-smelling prison of the damned.")

I'm a huge liar.

FIX:

Executables that have multiple parts, such as engines run from flatpak, are
now runnable if you put the full flatpak runnable name in the engine path,
such as:

flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom

Before, it would not parse it correctly since it expected a single command as
the full executable.

Game detects if you did not have an executable/path.

Internal name for the Run button is no longer generic.

2.0.0 ("Humans... is there anything more pathetic? A parasite on creation. The
plague of the universe.")

Okay, fine.  I'm a horrible liar and I will never stop updating this program.
(Just kidding.  This should be the final update.)

CHANGED:

enyo-doom is now licensed under the GPL version 3.  I had some concerns about
some of the things v3 protects so now it's been relicensed.  Deal with it.
This is reason 1 this version is now 2.0.0.

I did NOT like the numbers in the game list, so now it's an option selectable
in Settings.  The enabled numbers also were changed to look a bit more appealing to my eyes.

Huge code cleanup to fix some of the stupid hacks I used for some UI
manipulation rather than using what is supposed to be used.  

FIX:

AGAIN an attempt at fixing the "game name edit" button to actually show a
standard icon.  Seems like every time I "fix" it, it doesn't stay fixed and the icon
disappears.  Maybe this will finally fix it?

Not sure what to label this, but I noticed that the 1.0x versions of enyo-doom
should have been 1.0.x instead.  Oops.  That probably caused some versioning
issues.  Um... sorry.  This is reason 2 that this version is 2.0.0 to correct
this.

1.2 ("God rested on the seventh day. But imagine how much further along we
would be if he hadn't?")

I have decided to do one final release of enyo-doom before finally putting it
to rest.  

FIX:

The button to edit the game name was missing an icon on most systems.  This
should hopefully fix that issue.  It did have an icon during 1.1.1's
development and testing on different systems, so I have no idea what changed.
Hopefully this one will work.

CHANGED:

I have removed the fullscreen and sound options for game engines, given that
all game engines now include their own configurations for these things and
will correctly fall back to functioning settings if not.  If you still need
settings to override the default, you can them in advanced commandline
settings.

TWEAKS:

The code has been significantly cleaned up, organized, properly indented and
spaced, and so on, with only a few commented stubs of recent changes left
over.  It was way too much of a mess to leave it like that.

This should be the final version.  Thanks for your interest and support.  I'll
still use this myself to launch Doom in GNU because the same issue that made
me start this project exists: there's nothing better besides manually
launching from commandline, and I am lazy.

1.1.1 ("The horrors of Hell")

FIX:

Several organization and rename profile options not updating or working
correctly with the numbers in front of the profile.  

Adding an "any file" option for the WAD locator for a few edge cases where
other file extensions like pk3 are accepted as main WAD files.

enyo-doom for Microsoft Windows is untested and not supported, but a change makes the default
directory for searching for an engine binary for Windows C:\ rather than the
invalid for Windows path /usr (valid in GNU/Linux and similar) in case someone
wants to try building for Windows.

1.1.0 ("Don't leave yet - there's a demon around that corner!")

Stable (I hope!) release.

ADDED/CHANGED:

Everything from 1.06.9 and 1.06.99.

Some layout and labeling changes on the UI.

1.06.99 ("You wonder who the inmates of this corner of Hell will be.")

EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE NUMBER TWO.  YOU HAVE BEEN TWICE WARNED.  ABANDON ALL
HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE.  PREPARE FOR MELTING COMPUTERS, SICK PETS, AND
DYING PLANTS.  PLEASE REPORT ALL BUGS AND OTHER WEIRDNESS.  

ADDED:

Ability to move the order of PWADS around for the few cases that need strict
a certain PWAD order to run.

Numbers beside the game profile names to make reordering them using the up and
down buttons clearer.  This does make it look odd and I prefer without
numbers, but I do think it's much clearer when reordering, and better than
changing the profile to a list rather than a dropdown -- the list looked very
ugly to me when testing it.

1.06.9 ("Your assignment is clear: MERCILESS EXTERMINATION.")

EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE.  BEWARE OF CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION.  PLEASE REPORT IF ANY
OF THE FOLLOWING FEATURES DO NOT WORK OR HAVE UNINTENDED SIDE EFFECTS.

ADDED:

Ability to move game profiles up and down the list as well as rename them, per
request issue #1 (https://gitlab.com/sdcofer70/enyo-doom/issues/1).  I didn't
feel this was as much of an issue for the engine list, but I may implement it
for that as well in the future.

CHANGED:

To remove clutter and have space for the new game profile options, buttons now
use standard icon resources instead of being text.  This may be a problem for 
other systems like Windows, but it is the most efficient solution.  I may re-evaluate 
this decision and provide my own iconset in the future, but for now, this should
just work on GNU/Linux systems, which is my primary target system for
enyo-doom.

Overriding the default engine now uses a checkbox to enable, rather than
selecting a "none" option.

1.06 ("You are an experiment as well, so who cares?")

Minor tweaks:

Changed some code to be a bit more organized.

Changed a default engine from ZDoom to GZDoom since ZDoom is now
"discontinued" according to their web page.  You can still add it if you want
to use it.  This won't affect already saved engines.

Fixed a few outdated/changed things in README.md.

1.05 ("You're trying to say you like DOS better than me, right?")
ADDED:
Option to automatically exit enyo-doom after running a game.

CHANGED:
Version number is now displayed in application title.

1.04 ("Next stop, Hell on Earth!")

FIXED:
A fix to the change in 1.01 to fullscreen/windowed/engine default combobox was not
completely implemented correctly, setting the wrong mode especially when
removing existing game engines, plus code cleanup of legacy stubs/commented
code regarding the old fullscreen/windowed checkbox as well as the removed
MAXZONE setting.

Fixed a typo in the Windows implementation (inside #ifdefs so the error didn't
show up in non-Windows compiles); however, I have no idea if it even
still compiles correctly or even works since I no longer use Windows at all.  Would
appreciate testing.

1.03 ("The horrific challenges ahead may be too much for a jellyfish like yourself.")

CHANGED:
UI cleanup and organization.

ADDED: 
A couple of clarifying tooltips to UI elements.

1.02 ("Due to the incredible amount of time you wasted punching poor defenseless turkeys, your vacation time has been docked two days.")

CHANGED: 
The layout of the source has been modified to place all code in its own directory.
Small changes in text labels to hopefully make things a little clearer.

1.01 ("Super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3")

CHANGED:
The "Fullscreen" setting is now a combobox that selects between *forcing* fullscreen/windowed mode or letting the engine's setting decide, therefore not forcing fullscreen/windowed for engines that accept the "-fullscreen/-windowed" switches and have their own fullscreen/windowed settings.

1.0 ("Right between their beady little eyes")

Most of the fixes/changes/additions from the aborted 0.11/0.999 release, except for the icons, which was a bad idea.

CHANGED: 
Requires Qt5 now since Qt4 is essentially dead.

FIXED:
Tons of little code cleanups and text clarifications.

REMOVED: 
Memory setting, a reminant from Doomsday 1.8.6.  If your engine/setup needs a memory setting (-mb) add it to the custom commandline options (you probably don't).

0.10 ("Your darkest fears will soon be realized as your soul burns in Hell!")

Basically 0.9beta3, but with one addition:

ADDED:

A menu option that opens the enyo-doom Google Code page.

0.9beta3 ("Took your sweet time, Marine?")

The third in a series of betas, though I am unsure that it will lead to 1.0 at this time.  Maybe to 0.10.

CHANGED:
The About dialog has been fixed to be a real dialog and not just a cheap dialog box, with the return of the enyo-doom graphic as its header.

Keyboard shortcuts in the Game and Settings tabs have been fixed to be unique and therefore usable.

0.9beta2 ("There's nothing wrong with you that I can't fix... with my hands!")

This is the second in a series of betas leading to 1.0.

ADDED:
A menu with shortcuts.
The ability to move the tabs to the top.

CHANGED: 
About is no longer in a tab (accessible from a menu).  The current About dialog is a placeholder for now, it'll look better in a future beta.

0.9beta1 ("Doesn't suck - SDC")

This is the first in a series of betas leading to 1.0.  Things are subject to change and horrible breakage, so be warned.

CHANGED/FIXED:
Several UI elements, including tab orientation (better for widescreen), location of game selector and Run button, alignment of the Settings (was "General") tab elements, and explanatory text on the Output text element.

Future considerations for UI improvements: the removal of the About tab and Enyo-Doom graphic to put into its own window when invoked, a menu and toolbar, and/or the ability to change tab positions if you hate them being on the left, among other UI customizations.

0.8r2 ("Ooh, here it comes!  Here comes the night train!")

BUG:
Problem with the WAD file selector (file filter was incorrect) fixed.

0.8 ("Ooh, here it comes! Here comes the night train!")

After invalidating Bug 7, I am releasing 0.7.9.4 as final.  

No changes.

0.7.9.4 ("The sugar-sweet kiss of heavy ordinance")

Yet another test version.  See below.

ADDED:
Saves window geometry and position between runs.
Checks the path of the main game WAD to see if it's valid.
Confirmation dialog for removal of game types and engines.

CHANGED:
"Copy current game settings..." is now a standard Yes/No/Cancel dialog rather than a dropdown.

BUG:
Occasionally, the engine setting will revert to the first engine listed if another is selected.  I cannot reliably reproduce this and have no idea what's causing it.  This is definitely a 0.8 blocker.

0.7.9.3 ("Sweet Christmas!")

Probably the final test version before 0.8 is released.  

ADDED: 
"Lock this game type to engine".  This allows you to add game types that are dependent on a single engine without having to go change the main engine type.  By default this is set to "(Default)", which means it will use the engine set on the General tab.

FIXED: 
Window title is now "Enyo Doom" rather than just "Enyo" for consistency's sake.

CHANGED:
The logo.  I was uncomfortable with using a Doom game sprite in case there was any copyright issues so I removed it.
The logo now scales horizontally with the window.  It looks kind of ugly if scaled to extremes, but I'm sure you can live with it.

0.7.9.2 ("The capacity for violence")

Yet another version of the major Qt/C++ rewrite of Enyo-Doom.  Should be close to an actual release (0.8).

ADDED:
Removing game types.
Adding and removing engines.

ENHANCEMENT:
Busy cursor when Doom launched for engines/addons that take a moment to load (so you don't think it's locked up or anything).

NOTE: 
Doomsday support is now officially dropped, though you can re-add it with the engine selector and use custom launch options to add the correct launch options to support it.  Use the latest version of Doomsday's launcher (Snowberry) for it.  I will be adding a "lock game type to engine" option in the next version so you can add Doomsday-specific game types.

0.7.9.1 ("Your fat reward") 

The second version of the major Qt/C++ rewrite of Enyo-Doom.

RE-ADDED:

Adding game types. There will be a way to remove them in a future version.

Custom launch parameters.

FIXED/CHANGED:

A decent compile/install method. I now use CMake to generate the makefile used to build Enyo-Doom. It is recommended that you create a build directory then use cmake .. to create a Makefile. Using make install is now supported and should install in the prefix /usr/local (use cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr to install in /usr). 

0.7.9.0 ("Bringing forth eternal damnation and suffering.")

This is a MAJOR rewrite using Qt and C++, replacing the old GTK+/C code.  The first release is a test release, so bear with me while I iron out the problems and get everything back up to speed.

UNSUPPORTED:
Adding game types.  This should be in the next version (as well as the ability to remove existing games from the list).
Custom launch parameters.  Again, this should be in the next version.
The custom Doom engine option.  This will probably be in the version after next as the ability to add and remove any number of engines.
Doomsday/dengine.  Considering permanently dropping it due to the addition of its own launcher in the new version and the changing of its launch options.  My hope is that when the above options are added that it will be possible for users to manually add Doomsday by choosing it and creating custom launch parameters for it if you want.
A decent compile/install method.  Unless I'm missing something, I can't find a reliable method of allowing qmake to do a standard configure/install Makefile that supports splitting the executable and the support files.  I'm still figuring out how Qt works, though.  For now I'm putting everything in its own directory and calling from a script.  Compile using build.sh and install using install.sh (as root for systemwide install).
Saving window geometry.  Should return in the next version or so.

CHANGED:
Per-engine settings for windowed/non-windowed, sound and memory to allocate.  Makes more sense than making these global options.  So if you want to customize these, you'll need to set them for each engine.

0.7.4 ("And then John was a zombie.")

UPDATE: Code changes to GTK interface to allow it to successfully compile using GTK+3.  If you want to compile the GTK3 version, you will need the latest version of GTK3 (devel files as well) and follow the instructions in Makefile (uncommenting the GTK3 definitions and commenting the GTK2 ones).  
REQUIREMENTS: You now need to have GTK2 2.24 or later to compile this and future versions of enyo-doom due to the new GTK3-compatible code.  If you don't, you'll need to update or continue to use older versions of enyo.

0.7.3 ("Big &#$!*@# Gun")

CLEANUP: Major code cleanup, removing commented and dangling parts of code that aren't used anymore.  Also changed to a more direct widget referral method rather than using the clunky lookup_widget provided by Glade.
REVERT: Output window no longer hides when "Show engine output when running" is unchecked.  Changed my mind on that one.  
CHANGE: Selecting Doom Shareware no longer disables the Add button -- a dialog is shown instead if you try to add PWADS, which makes better sense than trying to figure out why it gets disabled.

0.7.2 ("Oremor nhoj em llik tsum uoy emag eht niw ot.")

BUGFIX: Disabled the Run Game button while a game is running to prevent a possible condidion where Enyo is still the active window and a user may be able to run the game again.

0.7.1 ("Paying for what happened to Daisy")

IMPORTANT: This is a testing release.  Don't use it unless you like stuff breaking.
CHANGE: IWAD selector is now using the GtkFileChooserButton widget to simplify the UI.  Leaving the engine chooser the same for now -- I may change that next testing version.
CLEANUP: Beginning of some code cleanup in rundoom.c that directly gets saved settings instead of pulling them from the UI, which is a leftover from very early code when I directly wrote settings to the settings file instead of using the intermediate settings array.  Will expand on this next testing version.

0.7 ("Potential pain and gibbitude")

IMPORTANT: This is a testing release.  Don't use it unless you like stuff breaking.
CHANGE: Binary, share directory, and settings directory now called "enyo-doom".  This was done to avoid potential conflict with any other applications known as "enyo".  The program should automatically migrate ~/.enyo/config to ~/.enyo-doom/config -- the method used may be faulty so make sure ~/.enyo/config has been deleted after you have closed Enyo 0.7 after this migration.  You may want to back up ~/.enyo/config just in case if you don't want to reconfigure everything.
ENHANCEMENT: Game engine combo now includes "Other Engine".  You can now use any other Doom engine as long as it obeys the same basic commandline parameters as Vanilla Doom.  The "Path to engine binary" will initially be blank when you select this; use Select to select the Doom binary you want to run (e.g. zdoom).
CLEANUP: Removal of old commented out code, plus embarrasingly even more references to the engine as "doomsday" regardless of what you have selected.
BUGFIX: Removal of old code referring to the old popup "Running" dialog in error handlers.

0.6.2 ("Smelling like sour lemons")

BUGFIX: Applied patch to fix Issue 5 ("gcc4.6.1 on Ubuntu 11.10 (possibly others) picky about order") that fixes a flood of "undefined reference" in the last step of the build.
ENHANCEMENT: "Switch to output when running" is now "Show engine output when running", and the new Output tab is now hidden when the option is unchecked.

0.6.1 ("Admitting a grudging respect for Fly Taggart")

BUGFIX: A few minor source changes for better C language compliance.
CHANGE/ENHANCEMENT/BUGFIX: The separate output window is now gone, replaced by an Output tab in the main interface, and the option to display the output window has now been changed to "Switch to output when running".  This change is not only to simplify the interface, but also to fix a glitch I've seen in some window managers that overlays the main window with an existing open window on the taskbar after the output window closes.

0.6 ("Diseased horrors hot to get their teeth into you")

BUGFIX: Fixed several text references to "gDoomsday" still lingering in error messages and other dialogs.
CHANGE: New graphic and easier to see icon.
This is a "stable" release -- no major issues have shown up during testing, but please report any issues.

0.5.2 ("You're supposed to win, aren't you?")

A lot going on for this release.
ENHANCEMENT: Changed the file dialog choosers to the more modern GTK+ ones over the old style that I've been using since Doomsday.
BUGFIX: Fixed a small problem with the last directory used where it would sometimes show the parent directory.  A side effect of this is that when you use it the first time in this release, it will not show a directory; however, when you choose a file, it will remember that directory and future ones you choose from now on.
ENHANCEMENT/BUGFIX: Last directory chosen now includes the add-on chooser as well.
BUGFIX: Several tooltips still referred to "Doomsday" only when they apply to all engines.
CHANGE: The save directory chooser for Doomsday has been removed completely; game settings are moved up into the main tab and is now called "Game".  Given that ~/.doomsday is a good choice for saving Doomsday settings and the rest of the engines create their own automatically, I figured it was time to depreciate this setting.  If there is massive public outcry for the return of this setting, I will do so, but it's best that you just let it be set in ~/.doomsday.
NOTE: This is still considered an experimental release, however, I am becoming more confident of its stability and the next release will likely be 0.6, which I will consider "stable".

0.5.1 ("I Am Death Incarnate!")

BUGFIX: Issue 3 ("call to __builtin__snprintf_chk will always overflow destination buffer" warning) fixed.
CLEANUP: Beginning of code cleanup and use of #DEFINEs instead of magic numbers through code.
ENHANCEMENT: Window geometry (not position) saved on exit and restored on next run.
NOTE: This is still an experimental release.  Please report any bugs and/or use 0.4.  0.6 will be the next stable release.

0.5 ("What the hell is this?")

ENHANCEMENT: Added custom commandline options for engines.  These will be saved and used regardless of engine selection (for now) so you will need to modify or remove them when changing engines if they are engine-specific commands.
ENHANCEMENT: You can now save a configuration of game engine, PWADs and custom commandline as a custom game type selectable in the drop-down list.  You must use the standard game types as a starting point.  For example, this will let you add "Hell Revealed" as a selectable game type that will automatically keep the Hell Revealed (hr.wad and hrmus.wad) PWADs associated with it, regardless of what you add or remove to Doom II.
NOTE: This is an experimental release.  If you have issues, please open a bug report and/or use 0.4 until this becomes more stable.

0.4 ("The Unmaker")

ENHANCEMENT: Support for prBoom.
ENHANCEMENT: Menu shortcut created (under "Games").
ENHANCEMENT: An icon!
ENHANCEMENT/BUGFIX: Removal of Heretic and Hexen from the menus when chocolate-doom or prBoom is selected.
BUGFIX: No longer asks for path to "Doomsday" when selecting engine path (doesn't make sense with chocolate-doom or prBoom).

0.3.3: ("I'm an idiot.")

BUGFIX: Previous fix for Shareware Doom made PWADs nonfunctional using Doomsday.  Man, I'm an idiot.  

0.3.2: ("Still Alive")

BUGFIX: Running Shareware Doom under chocolate-doom failed because of a dangling commandline parameter that should not be there.

0.3.1: ("Scientific Miscalculation")

BUGFIX: Incorrect value in string handling function that caused GCC to spit out warnings and glibc to crash the program in newer versions with "fortify source".
BUGFIX: Suppressed warning in string handler due to not having a formatting string.
PACKAGE: Now extracts to its own directory.  Oops.  How did I miss that one?

0.3: ("Scientific Miscalculation")

ENHANCEMENT: New program settings code and configuration file
(~/.enyo/config).  Probably buggy as hell at the moment.  You WILL have to
redo your settings as they will not carry over from the old config file.
KNOWN ISSUE: Spaces in path names don't work, Doom doesn't really like spaces
anyway being a DOS game originally; however, this will be investigated.

0.2.1: ("USE US")

BUGFIX: Chocolate Doom did not revert to fullscreen when Run In Window
unchecked.
BUGFIX: No setting for Chocolate Doom path defaulted to "doomsday" instead of
"chocolate-doom".
PACKAGE: Added Changelog and COPYING to share directory on install.
PACKAGE: Changed file permissions of enyo.png on install to 644

0.2: ("USE US")

ADDED: Preliminary support for Chocolate Doom.
OTHER: Code base for a new settings file added (not implemented yet).
Settings file is still ~/.gdoomsday for now.

0.1: INITIAL RELEASE ("Welcome to the Dungeon, Marine")

This release is simply a rename and conversion from the old gDoomsday (http://gdoomsday.sf.net) code base.  Some identification has been changed from gDoomsday to Enyo (but not the banner image yet).  Autoconf/automake has been changed to a simple Makefile.  0.2 will be the beginning of significant code and other changes to Enyo.
